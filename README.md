spring-xd-ec2
=============
This project simply allows you to deploy an XD cluster to ec2.  

Compiling
----------
* Once you have pulled the project from github go to the project root directory.
* To create an zip distribution execute the following: ./gradlew distZip
	* Once the compile is complete the distribution zip will be located in:
	 ${spring-xd-ec2}/build/distributions/spring-xd-ec2-1.0.zip

Installing
----------
1) Unzip spring-xd-ec2-1.0.zip

2) cd to the spring-ec2-1.0 directory

3) edit the config/xd-ec2.properties

	* set aws-access-key property to your AWS Access Key
	* set aws-secret-key property to your AWS Secret Key
	* set private-key-file to the location of your RSA private key and matching public-key-name
	* set the cluster-name property to the name you want to show up in the EC2 Instance console
	* set the user-name property to your name
	* set the description property, to define the purpose of this cluster.
	* set the xd-dist-url to be a specific .zip located in the one of the Spring repositories
	  * https://repo.spring.io/simple/libs-snapshot-local/org/springframework/xd/spring-xd/1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/
	  * https://repo.spring.io/simple/libs-milestone-local/org/springframework/xd/spring-xd
	* To run multiple nodes, set multi-node=true and set the number-nodes key to the number of nodes you want to run.
        * Optionally set machine-size,region
	* Save 

Running
----------
1) From the spring-xd-ec2 directory run the install: ./bin/spring-xd-ec2
	* When the install is complete it will list the DNS name to your newly created instance. e.g.

	Admin Node Instance: ec2-54-205-186-126.compute-1.amazonaws.com has been created
	Container Node Instance: ec2-54-197-79-170.compute-1.amazonaws.com has been created


properties
----------
XD allows a user to change it's behavior by updating environment variables.  Since XD-EC2 allows users to deploy a multi node xd instance it will allow you to set these environment variables on all the nodes.  This is done by adding the XD Environment variables you want updated to the xd-ec2.properties.  
For example if you  wanted to update the rabbit and amq locations you would add these to the bottom of your xd-ec2.properties file.

```
mqtt.url=tcp://ec2-54-205-58-170.compute-1.amazonaws.com:1883
mqtt.default.client.id=xd.mqtt.client.id
mqtt.username=guest
mqtt.password=guest
mqtt.default.topic=xd.mqtt.test

brokerURL=tcp://ec2-54-205-58-170.compute-1.amazonaws.com:61616
```

Setting Up Job Repository
----------
Unlike singlenode deloyments, clusters (1 admin with 1+ containers) require that a job RDBMS datasource be specified for the admin server.
Through XD-EC2 this can be done by setting up the datasource properties in you xd-ec2.properties file.
For example:
```
#Database settings
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://xdjobasd.adsfadsa.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306/xdjob
spring.datasource.username=myxdjob
spring.datasource.password=mypassword
spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
```

Using static resources (zookeeper, rabbit or redis)
----------
The default behavior of spring-xd-ec2 is to start zookeeper, redis and rabbit on the admin node and have all the containers references these instances.  In cases where the containers and admin need to reference existing resources, the existing resources can be enumerated in the xd-ec2.properties file.  
For example:
```
#XD Properties
spring.redis.address=ec2-1-2-3-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com:6379
spring.rabbitmq.addresses=ec2-6-7-8-9.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5672
spring.zookeeper.addresses=ec2-10-11-12-13.compute-1.amazonaws.com:2181,ec2-14-15-16-17.compute-1.amazonaws.com:2181,ec2-18-19-20-21.compute-1.amazonaws.com:2181
```
You may use the properties individually and for the ones  not present, then the default behavior enumerated above will be used.

Container Specific Properties
----------
XD Supports XD.CONTAINER.GROUPS such that you can assign modules to a specific container group.  To support this feature XD-EC2 allows the user to create container specific property settings.  This is done by prefixing any property value with XD<digit>. .  The digit represents the container you want the property to be associated.  For example:  If you wanted Container 0 to belong to group0 and Container 1 to belong to groupA you would add the following to your XD-EC2.properties file.
```
#Container Specific settings
XD1.XD.CONTAINER.GROUPS=GROUPA
XD0.XD.CONTAINER.GROUPS=GROUP0
```

Using
----------

1) SSH into the boxes using the Public DNS names that were listed at the end of the install process, e.g.

$ ssh -i xd-key-pair.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-205-186-126.compute-1.amazonaws.com
